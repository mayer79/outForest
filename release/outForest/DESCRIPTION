Description: Provides a random forest based implementation of
    the method described in Chapter 7.1.2 ('Regression Model Based Anomaly
    detection') of Chandola et al. (2009)
    <dx.doi.org/10.1145/1541880.1541882>. It works as follows: Each
    numeric variable is regressed onto all other variables. If the scaled
    absolute difference between observed value and out-of-bag prediction
    of the corresponding random forest regression is suspiciously large
    (e.g. three times the RMSE of the random forest), then a value is
    considered an outlier. Our package offers different options to replace
    such outliers, e.g. by realistic values found via predictive mean
    matching. The method can be viewed as a multivariate extension of a
    basic univariate outlier detection method where a value is considered
    an outlier if it is more than e.g. three times the standard deviation
    away from its mean. In the multivariate case, instead of comparing a
    value with the overall mean, rather the difference to the conditional
    mean is considered. The 'outForest' package estimates this conditional
    mean by a random forest. Once the method is trained on a reference
    data, it can be applied to new data.
