Description: Provides a random forest based implementation of
    the method described in Chapter 7.1.2 (Regression model based anomaly
    detection) of Chandola et al. (2009) <doi:10.1145/1541880.1541882>. It
    works as follows: Each numeric variable is regressed onto all other
    variables by a random forest. If the scaled absolute difference
    between observed value and out-of-bag prediction of the corresponding
    random forest is suspiciously large, then a value is considered an
    outlier. The package offers different options to replace such
    outliers, e.g. by realistic values found via predictive mean matching.
    Once the method is trained on a reference data, it can be applied to
    new data.
