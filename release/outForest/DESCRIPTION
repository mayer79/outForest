Description: Provides a random forest based implementation of
    the method described in Chapter 7.1.2 ('Regression Model Based Anomaly
    detection') of Chandola et al. (2009)
    <doi.acm.org/10.1145/1541880.1541882>. It works as follows: Each
    numeric variable is regressed onto all other variables by a random
    forest. If the scaled absolute difference between observed value and
    out-of-bag prediction of the corresponding random forest is
    suspiciously large, then a value is considered an outlier. Our package
    offers different options to replace such outliers, e.g. by realistic
    values found via predictive mean matching. Once the method is trained
    on a reference data, it can be applied to new data.
