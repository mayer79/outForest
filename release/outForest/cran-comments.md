Resubmission due to warning

- Missing "rmarkdown" in suggested packages due to failed vignette build warning. None of my checks detected this problem, neither did all online package checks. A little bit frustrating.

Original purpose:

- Fixing a suboptimal "doi" in the description field, as suggested by Kurt Hornik.
