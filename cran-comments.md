* This is a resubmission, reacting on the very helpful hints by Jelena, see below.

"Please shorten the title to a maximum of 65 characters.
Acronyms can be used on their own in the title as long as they are 
explained in the description field."

-> Done. The title is now much shorter: "Multivariate Outlier Detection and Replacement"

"There is no need to credit the copyright holder seperately, if they are 
also the author of the package."

-> Done. Removed copy-right holder from the roles.

"Please only write package names, software names and API names in single 
quotes in title and description. e.g: --> (Regression Model Based 
Anomaly detection)"

-> Fixed. Removed quotes.

"Additionally it seems like you are using title case here in which case 
it should be Detection, not detection."

-> Fixed. Removed title case.

In the description you say "our package" but only you are credited. If 
other people helped create it, please credit them using f.i. the roles 
contributor or author. If not, please change the misleading wording.

-> Replaced "Our" by "The".
